        info: `Don't make us laugh. The green hair. The crazed smile. The maniacal cackle. You know exactly who he is and how far he'd go to put a smile on your face.

        Whether by way of award-winning films like "The Dark Knight," Emmy-winning animated programs like "Batman: The Animated Series," video game appearances such as the record-breaking "Batman: Arkham Asylum," or the countless comics stacking comic book shelves and digital libraries, the Joker stands unquestionably as the most recognizable and popular comic book villain in pop culture history. Unpredictable, violent and incredibly dangerous, he is chaos personified and has taken on everyone from his archenemy Batman to even the Man of Steel.
        
        But Gotham remains his primary home and Batman his biggest adversary, and no hero is perhaps better suited as in many ways, the Joker is the polar opposite of the Dark Knight. Both were created by a great tragedy, but Batman has since vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent similar incidents, the Joker revels in creating chaos and destroying lives, believing that life’s a big joke and psychotically demonstrating that in a moment, it can all change.
        
        Not much is known about his past, but his acts during the present are what define the Joker as one of the greatest threats to our heroes and the people they've sworn to protect. He's killed a Robin, crippled Batgirl, and tortured and murdered countless people throughout the DC Universe—all just for a laugh.`

        info: `Armed with the Anti-Life Equation, the Dark Lord of Apokolips and father of Orion seeks to control all sentient life throughout the universe…and beyond.

        In the known DC Multiverse, one name stands above all others when it comes to supreme villainy—Darkseid. Ruling over the hellish world of Apokolips, Darkseid doesn’t merely mean to conquer a planet or subjugate his enemies—he seeks to rob the entire universe of its free will and replace it with his own.
        
        To this end, Darkseid employs the vast power at his disposal to seek out the Anti-Life Equation, a mysterious formula that would allow him to remove all free will from every sentient life-form in the known universe. In his quest for ultimate power, the immortal Darkseid has repeatedly come into conflict with Apokolips’ sister world, the heavenly New Genesis, along with heroes like Superman and the Justice League.
        
        Ruling over a court of equally twisted and sadistic individuals and commanding an army of mindless Parademons who obey his every whim, Darkseid can be defeated, but never truly destroyed. As long as malice and despair exist, the God of Evil will always find a way to return and attempt to spread his tyrannical rule over all who live. On Apokolips, there’s only one key thing every subject must understand about their ruler—Darkseid IS. There is nothing else.`

        title: "Sinestro",
        info: `"In blackest day, in brightest night, beware your fears made into light. Let those who try to stop what's right, burn like my power, Sinestro's might!"

        From the greatest Green Lantern to the Corps' greatest enemy, Thaal Sinestro's fall from grace can easily be attributed to his own hubris—but if you ask him, the real problem lies in the Green Lantern Corps itself and its creators, the Guardians of the Universe. After all, as far as Sinestro is concerned, everything he does is for the good of the universe.
        
        Originally hailing from the planet Korugar, Sinestro once served as the Green Lantern of Sector 1417 and quickly gained recognition among the Corps for his ability to police his sector. However, peace came at a price. Sinestro's determination to preserve order caused him to act more as a dictator than a protector, conquering his own home planet in the process. Control became his means to an end, the true path to order in both his sector and the universe as a whole, and Sinestro did anything necessary to achieve it. It wasn't until then new recruit Hal Jordan learned of Sinestro's methods that the Guardians were informed and Sinestro was ejected from the Corps.
        
        Steadfast in his belief of moral superiority and methods of maintaining order, Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, harnessing the yellow energy of fear, to not only combat the Guardians, whom he sees as the main obstacle on the path to intergalactic peace, but to also strengthen the Green Lantern Corps. For it is Sinestro’s opinion that the Green Lanterns have long since been held back by their creators.
        
        Highly intelligent with an almost unbreakable will, Thaal Sinestro will do anything to achieve control and thereby order—control over his emotions, control over others, and even control over the entire universe.`

        A formidable operative for the U.S. military, Col. Slade Wilson agreed to undergo an experimental process that increased his mental and physical abilities to superhuman levels. Rather than continue his career as a soldier, Slade became the masked mercenary Deathstroke. This decision resulted in his wife leaving him and his son Joseph being permanently injured, as well as the death of his son Grant, who sought to emulate Slade.
        
        Over the years, Slade has fought many DC superheroes, particularly the Teen Titans, and even been incarcerated, only to escape. He has also occasionally worked with Earth’s heroes and the U.S. government to protect the planet or serve what he considers to be a greater good. But despite his occasional heroics, Slade Wilson ultimately deferred to whatever benefited himself, finding loopholes in his own code of honor to justify betrayal and manipulation.`

        info: `For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. And with every step the Flash takes toward the future, someone from the future is racing backward through time to stop him—the villainous speedster known as the Reverse-Flash.

        Born in the 25th Century, Eobard Thawne grew up idolizing the Flash and studying the legacy of the Scarlet Speedster. However, as he learned more about the Flash, Eobard discovered how his own life was linked to his hero’s: He was destined to become one of Barry Allen’s greatest villains, a revelation that led Eobard to grow unhinged. When he eventually replicated the chemical accident that granted the Flash super speed, Eobard took on a new identity—that of the Reverse-Flash, a wicked subversion of everything the Flash stands for.
        
        Granted with powers and abilities similar to that of the Flash, the Reverse-Flash is unwavering in his determination to oppose and destroy all that’s important to the Flash. His ability to travel through time allows him to attack the Flash at almost any point throughout history. However, he is unable to ever kill the Flash—for the Reverse-Flash would not exist if he killed his own inspiration. Instead, he does everything in his power to torment and torture the hero, an ominous visitor from a future the Flash never could’ve envisioned.`

        Considered one of Aquaman’s greatest enemies, Black Manta has a singular hatred for the King of Atlantis. For decades, Manta’s true name and motives were shrouded in mystery, hidden behind his menacing oversize helmet. In modern times, however, his true motivations have been revealed.
        
        But no matter the era, Black Manta has always inflicted a special kind of pain upon his archenemy, cementing his reputation as one of the most ruthless and driven criminals in DC history.`

        info: `Other people may see Superman as the greatest hero the world has ever known—a benevolent being with tremendous power, a strange visitor here to help. But one man sees him as something else entirely: a threat—a creature whose very existence hinders humanity, preventing it from ever reaching its true potential.

        A self-made man whose immeasurable intellect is always in conflict with his equally immeasurable ego, Lex Luthor is one of the world's most brilliant minds and most famous villains. From a young age, Lex utilized his almost unparalleled acumen to build himself a financial empire through hard work and dedication—but mainly through the strategic use of intimidation, bribery and murder. Sacrificing other people became simply a means to an end on the path to success, but Luthor always made sure none of his deplorable acts could be traced back to him. Instead, his climb to power and rise in status made him someone to look up to, someone people wanted to emulate—and he relished in the adoration.
        
        Until it all changed the day Superman appeared and gave the world something else to aspire to.
        
        Driven by jealousy masked with hate over what he perceives to be his stolen place as humanity's true savior, Luthor constantly attempts to destroy and humiliate Superman at every possible opportunity. He's willing to lie, cheat, steal, manipulate and go to any extreme necessary to accomplish his goals, not caring one bit about who he hurts. He is a man who not only wants to be seen as a god, but who has convinced himself he's the only one this worlds needs.`

        Superman’s nemesis Lex Luthor may be the smartest criminal mind on Earth, but his intellect is no match for the alien artificial intelligence known as Brainiac. Nevertheless, Brainiac shares Luthor’s intense hatred of the Man of Steel, and has continued to use his Twelfth-Level intellect over the years to bring down the Last Son of Krypton.
        
        Originally from the planet most frequently named Colu, Brainiac’s artificial mind and body have morphed several times over the decades, but his unquenchable thirst for absolute knowledge, regardless of the billions of innocent lives which might be destroyed in the process, has made him one of the deadliest villains the universe has ever seen. For Brainiac, the knowledge he acquires is only valuable if he and he alone possesses it, and no one else.
        
        Thanks to his highly advanced, computerized brain, Brainiac is always ten steps ahead of his opponents, even ones as clever as Superman. Ultimately, his inability to see beyond pure logic has always been his downfall. But like a bad computer virus that can never be fully purged, Brainiac always manages to turn up again when one least expects him.`

        Thousands of years before Billy Batson became a magically-empowered hero, the wizard Shazam selected another champion. Teth-Adam or “Mighty Adam” began as a hero of humanity, but then allowed his power to corrupt his ideals and desires. Now labeled Black Adam, he was exiled by Shazam, but returned in the modern day. A frequent enemy to Earth’s heroes, Black Adam believes he is the right person to lead humanity and any action he takes is necessary for the greater good.`

        In the annals of villainy, there are few bad guys as likable as Captain Cold. Seeing himself as a blue-collar, working man’s super-villain, Cold has a code of honor, one that prevents him from killing innocent people...though he’s more than happy to rob them blind.
        
        Armed with a sophisticated cold gun, Leonard Snart has been tangling with the Flash since his earliest days. The self-appointed leader of the Rogues, a loose band of criminals united in their hatred of the Scarlet Speedster, Captain Cold has consistently pitted his “absolute zero” against the Flash’s super-speed.
        
        Although a largely unrepentant criminal who loves nothing more than a successful heist, Cold’s noble side can be appealed to, and he’s helped the good guys on more than one occasion. But whatever you do, don’t confuse him with Batman baddie Mr. Freeze. He really hates that.`

        Cain and Abel. Zeus and Poseidon. King Richard and Prince John. Ever since the beginning of time, there have been tales of brothers vs. brother. And the underwater kingdom of Atlantis is no different, having given rise to the legendary rivalry between Arthur, King of Atlantis, and his half-brother, Orm Marius, who is better known as the Ocean Master.
        
        Orm is eternally jealous of his brother, known on the surface world as Aquaman, and has dedicated his life to not only taking his throne away from him—and thereby taking it for himself—but also destroying everything and everyone that he holds dear. Although they are related by blood, Orm has none of his brother’s nobility or charity, and only exhibits ruthlessness and sadism. 
        
        Although the nature of their brotherhood has changed over the decades, it seems that the two half-brothers are always destined to be at odds no matter how the universe shakes out. Ocean Master will never rest until his older brother is destroyed and the throne of Atlantis belongs to him.`

        Sometimes all it takes is the smallest ember to spark a raging inferno. Mick Rory’s love of fire started innocently enough when he was a small child, but it turned deadly the moment he set his childhood home ablaze and watched from afar as his family was consumed by the flames.
        
        As he grew older, Mick’s pyromania grew uncontrollable. Inspired by Central City’s band of costumed super-villains, the Rogues, Mick invented a handgun-sized flamethrower and a flame-retardant suit for himself. He adopted the code name “Heat Wave” as he began channeling his destructive urges into profit. Eventually, and despite his contentious relationship with the Rogues’ leader, Captain Cold, Mick became an official member of the criminal organization.
        
        Hotheaded and volatile, Heat Wave’s endless need to find an outlet for his peculiar obsession makes him dangerous and unpredictable, but not altogether evil. He’s sometimes turned over new—if slightly charred—leaves at the behest of superheroes, who’ve offered him more productive ways to turn up the heat.`

        One of the deadliest assassins in the DC Universe, Floyd Lawton, a.k.a. Deadshot, has no real superhuman abilities, unless you count his uncannily accurate aim and affection for firearms of all types. Boasting that he never misses a shot, Lawton became infamous as a deadly marksman and gun-for-hire, a reputation that earned him no shortage of trouble with both the law and the superhero community.
        
        During one of his prison stays, Lawton was recruited by Amanda Waller to join the covert Task Force X, otherwise known as the Suicide Squad, in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. A thrill-seeker with a self-destructive personality, Lawton readily accepted the terms and went on to become one of the Squad’s longest-serving members.

        In order to wage his unending war on injustice, Batman has developed his body as perfectly as he has his mind. But there’s one man who’s broken him. A man who stands in many ways as his exact opposite—a physical marvel and a genius without peer. But whereas the Dark Knight was born to fight crime, Bane was destined for a life of corruption.
        
        Born in a prison on a remote Caribbean island, Bane was raised without pity or compassion. As an adult, he served as a test subject for the super-steroid called Venom. Superhumanly strong, Bane escaped his hell and headed to Gotham City—where he chose to make his mark by defeating the Batman. Though he succeeded, their initial battle was far from their last.
        
        Since then, Bane has repeatedly tried to amass not only power, but territory, whether it’s Gotham City or his home of Santa Prisca. Often at war with his personal dependence on the super-serum that gives him his strength, Bane will never stop fighting to prove he deserves to rule.`

But that doesn’t mean there’s not good money to be made in the taking of it, and when it comes to killing, there are few better than Lobo—the most brutally effective bounty hunter in the galaxy.

        Lobo was born on the utopian planet of Czarnia. Unfortunately for them, the foul-mouth brawler’s idea of a perfect world is one covered in bruises and blood. He wiped out his entire civilization and made himself the last of his people. Considering his name means "he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it" in his native tongue, perhaps they shouldn’t have been too surprised. Lobo took his predilection for murder and mayhem along with his rocket-fueled motorcycle and went on to become the best bounty hunter in the galaxy.
        
        Lobo looks out for himself first and foremost, and is never without a plan to cash in at other people’s expense. Though he’s glad to use weapons, Lobo doesn't really need them. His super-strength means his fists are made for bashing. Couple that with his advanced healing powers and unquenchable thirst for blood, and he’s proven to be an incredibly difficult foe to stop—unless you can trick him into entering into a deal. Mercenary or not, Lobo always keeps his word…though he’s not above getting creative in his interpretation of “true to his promise.” As an intergalactic bounty hunter, Lobo's gigs take him all over the universe, but he never lingers for long because there's always someone or something else to apprehend, preferably as painfully as possible.`

        Like all Kryptonians, Zod gains an array of powers after exposure to Earth’s yellow sun—including, but not limited to, super-strength, flight, super-speed, invulnerability, heat vision and x-ray vision. Beyond his physical abilities, Zod also possess a dangerously intelligent mind with a gift for strategy.

With an ebony mask fused to his face, Roman set out to destroy Bruce and take control of the city that failed him, by whatever means necessary.
